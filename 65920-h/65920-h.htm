<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>SCENE</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">The woods in winter. If scenery is not available,
a generous supply of white sheets and cotton batting will make an
effective setting, with a few small evergreens, and bare boughs. A
large Christmas tree should be utilized as part of the scene; place it
to right of center, and trim lightly with silver tinsel, “snow,” and
glass icicles. Near the tree, a couch or seat should be built up and
covered with white, to represent a little mound; upon this the Queen
sits, and later, the children recline. The time is about sunset; a
red light, if available, will be effective early in the scene, while
toward the end it grows darker. A curtain is not absolutely necessary,
although of course more “like a play.”</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>MUSIC</b></p>

<p class="neg-indent space-below2">The airs mentioned may all be found

<p class="f120 space-above1"><b>GENERAL REMARKS ABOUT PRACTICAL DETAILS</b></p>

<p>The play may be given without a curtain, but if one is available, it
may be used at the beginning and end. In the middle, it is better not
to use it, as the quiet, empty room is much more impressive than any
curtain could be.</p>

<p>The two littlest “real children” may be two or three years old, as they
can be piloted through their parts by Harry and Nell. The part of Miss
Muffet can be taken by a child of five or six years. Harry and Nell and
the other children may range from nine to fourteen years. Santa Claus
and Mother Goose may be taken by a big boy and girl, or by “grown-ups.”</p>

<p class="f120"><b>COSTUMES</b></p>

<p>For the two smallest children, long nightgowns; Harry, striped pajamas;
Nell, a long white nightgown and over it a gaily colored wrapper. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Mother Goose children to be dressed as nearly like their pictures as
possible. In general, the Kate Greenaway style should be followed. The
boys wear tunics of cheese cloth, over their own loose knickerbockers,
the tunics loosely belted in. Broad white Puritan collars and cuffs may
be cut out of stiff white muslin. Their edges need not be finished, as
they hold very well.</p>

<p>Miss Muffet, pink and white, exactly like the pictures; Bo-Peep, a
shepherdess costume of figured blue-and-pink cretonne over a blue
skirt, and big white hat. Jill, a real Kate Greenaway girl, in blue and
white; Mistress Mary, also Kate Greenaway, in yellow and white. Mother
Goose, a black waist, with big white fichu, black overskirt over red
underskirt, high-peaked hat, made by rolling stiff brown paper into a
cone, cutting it even around the bottom, and fastening it to an old hat
crown which has a narrow rim of black velvet. The joining is covered by
a narrow band of gilt paper pasted on.</p>

<p>The Mother Goose book should be made for the occasion, out of
Bristol-board or corrugated packing board, with pages made of brown
wrapping-paper, and the cover picture of Mother Goose pasted upon the
outside. The change in the color of the hat is easily effected in
this way: the hat in the cover picture is painted red in the first
place. Then a bit of brown paper cut the same shape as the peak is
lightly pasted on over it. After the book is taken off the stage by the
children, this bit of paper is pulled off, so that when Santa Claus
brings the book in again, the hat is red. The inside pages of the book,
of course, are never seen at all by the audience.</p>

<p>Real toys are put into the stockings, so that the joy of the “real
children” in pulling the things out, especially of the two-and
three-year-olds, is entirely genuine and spontaneous.</p>

<p>If it were desired to use fewer characters, one or two of the Mother
Goose children can easily be cut out. If more characters are wanted,
they can be added, such as Old King Cole, needing a new bowl; Tom, Tom,
the Piper’s Son, needing a new pipe; the Queen of Hearts, needing a new
batch of tarts, etc.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> Oh, Jack, what a bad pun! Now see if you can’t
subside and not make any more trouble for Mother Goose. You know it is only
three more days before Santa has to start off with his pack, and there
are many things for you to do to help him get ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Oh, excuse me, everybody. I wish I could
learn calm, cool manners. Maybe I could behave better if I wasn’t so hungry.
Couldn’t I have something to eat? I haven’t eaten a thing since
breakfast but three tallow candles, and I’m starving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> Yes, you shall have a little snack
right now, Jack, as supper will not be ready for some time yet. You must attend
the door to-night, as the Auld Lang Syne Club holds its annual meeting
here this evening, you know. [<i>She hurries out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> I wish Santa would let me run the wireless,
instead of always having me tend reindeer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> [<i>Entering with tray.</i>] Here,
Jack, is a little luncheon for you—a bowl of ice-cream, a piece of frosted cake,
and some iced tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> [<i>Seating himself.</i>] Oh, Mother Goose,
you are the best cook at the Pole. Oh, how good and cold everything tastes. But
where is Santa? I thought he was too busy to leave home to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> He went out a little while ago to see
if there were any messages at the Wireless Station. He thinks he has at last got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the wireless line in working order. It runs from the Pole now to every
school yard in the country, you know. He expects great fun in hearing
the children of the world planning for their Christmas trees and
stockings. There will be no more mistakes in presents now, for every
boy and girl will get just what Santa hears him or her wishing for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> [<i>Looking out.</i>] Why, here comes dear
old Santa now, and he looks quite sad. I wonder if the wireless line is out of
order after all the trouble he has had trying to get connections made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa.</span> [<i>Enters and flings himself in easy-chair.</i>]
Well, Mother Goose and Jennie, you can put away your needles, and Jack, just
turn the reindeer loose again. There will be no Christmas gifts for
anybody this year, nor any other year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> No Christmas gifts! Never again any Christmas gifts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa.</span> That’s what I said. Never again any Christmas gifts!
Santa Claus will never be seen away from the North Pole again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> Why, Santa, you might as well say there
will be no more skating or coasting. Winter without Santa Claus and Christmas
is unbelievable. I can’t bear to think of your never again carrying
Christmas gifts to the children. How can you think of stopping that custom?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> I feel just as bad as you do about
stopping my annual visit and my gifts. Ever since I can remember I’ve been
distributing gifts to children at Christmas time; and until an hour ago
I expected to keep it up always, but now Santa Claus and his Christmas
rounds are at an end forever!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> But what has happened, Santa, to put
this into your mind? Have you had a fall on the ice and do you feel a little dazed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> This is one of your jokes, Santa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Oh, come off, now, Santa. You almost gave <i>me</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> No; I am in dead earnest. My head never
was clearer. I’ll tell you how it is. You will hardly believe me, but up at
the Wireless to-day, I got the shock of my life. I went up and sat on
an iceberg at the foot of the Pole to listen to what the children of
different playgrounds were saying about Christmas, and what gifts they
expected, and so on. I had my note-book ready to write what this one
and that one wanted. And—oh, I can hardly tell you—I heard children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
from three different cities talking about Christmas and saying they did
not believe in Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Not believe in Santa Claus? Impossible! Preposterous!
And that, too, after all the gifts—dolls and Noah’s arks and bags of candy
you have scattered around the world!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Maybe they think I have been chasing reindeer
to the end of the rainbow for—nobody!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> I knew you’d hardly believe it. I would not
believe it myself if I hadn’t heard the words just as plainly as I hear
you all talking now. One little girl in Boston was talking to quite
a lot of little comrades. “Pooh,” she said, “no well-informed person
nowadays believes in Santa Claus. Santa Claus is only a medieval myth”—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> Medieval! What’s that? There’s nothing <i>evil</i>
about you, Santa. You are just three hundred pounds of solid goodness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Oh, Jennie, I thought they all loved me as you
do; and it is hard to find they don’t believe in me, after all my years
of Christmas visits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> Go on, Santa dear. What else did you hear over
that horrid wireless line?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Well, some boys were talking in a school
yard in Chicago, and one of them said loudly: “You can’t fool me. There isn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
any Santa Claus, and there never was. He is nothing but a picture in
the books, like Uncle Sam!” And he was a boy with a pair of mittens on
his hands that I’d given him last Christmas. He was that curly-haired
boy I think, Jennie, that you’ve been knitting mittens for ten years,
each year a size larger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> Oh, isn’t he ungrateful? And here I have another pair
almost finished for him this year, too. [<i>Holds up red mittens.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> I’ll give that fellow a nip yet. I’ll make him believe
in <i>me</i>, anyhow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> Those certainly were cruel speeches, Santa.
But let us hear the worst. What else did they say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Some little girls in Los Angeles were at the
school gate and I heard one saying, “Oh, Santa Claus will do for
babies. But when you are seven you ought to say he’s just make-believe,
like the Sand Man and such folks.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> I don’t wonder you feel hurt, Santa,
after all your kindness to children. But you must remember that these were
only three out of all the school yards in the country. There must be
hundreds of other children who <i>do</i> believe in you. Perhaps these
just happened to be the few who don’t believe in fairies, either. There
are some such strange children I have heard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> Oh, Peter Pan will convince those
foolish children who don’t believe in fairies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> Never mind, Santa. I am
sure there cannot be many children of that unbelieving kind. But I wish
you had never had your wireless rigged up. It seems only to make you
unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> [<i>Sighing.</i>] It
<i>has</i> made me unhappy. I never felt so sad in all my life before.
I shall order the wireless telegraph discontinued to-morrow. I shall
give up the wireless line and the Christmas business altogether—Dear
me, how lonesome I shall be for the children!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> I shall not be sorry to
have you give up the wireless line, Santa. I can’t bear to think of
your stopping this lovely custom of gift-giving. You have made so many
children happy, and so many little believing hearts will miss you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> It does seem sad, Mother
Goose. But I shall never have the heart to set out again at Christmas
time with the bells jingling, and the reindeer galloping and the
sleigh flashing over the snow. I shall never again go crowding down
the chimneys to cram stockings and load the children’s trees. All that
pleasure is over forever, and I used to be so happy and so busy at Christmas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> But I should think you would be
glad enough to give up that stunt of scrooging down chimneys. Suppose
you’d get stuck some night!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> I’m sorry for the children who
will expect you, Santa, but I am glad you will not have to work so
hard any more. You have given your whole time to getting ready for
Christmas, just to make other people happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Oh, I’d gladly take all the
danger and all the trouble of that Christmas journey and all the work
of getting ready for it, if I were sure the children would care to have
me come. But to be just an intruder, it is too much. I shall never go
Christmasing again. Never, never, never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie.</span> Oh, Santa, don’t be so sure of
that. Let’s think it over. If you don’t go, what shall we do with
all these toys and dolls in the attic and cellar and on the shelves
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Oh, have a rummage sale of
them, Jennie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> But what use shall we have for the
reindeer that I have been watching all year?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Oh, give them to the Peary
expedition when it gets to the North Pole. Really, I’d be glad to go
just as I always have if I thought I was welcome; but you see how it
is! I must not intrude where I’m not wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span> Santa, don’t decide yet.
The Auld Lang Syne Club, as you know, is to meet here to-night. Let us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
put the case before those old friends and hear what they advise.
What do you say to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> That is a good suggestion.
These people of the Auld Lang Syne Club have all had experience in
the world. They will be able to give me an expert opinion. I will do
whatever they all seem to think best.</p>

take that seriously, do you? Why, I have heard that gossip for years,
and I have also heard people saying that they did not believe the story
of George Washington chopping down the cherry-tree. And yet I used to
know a lady who knew a lady whose cousin’s brother-in-law had a piece
of cherry-pie made from cherries that grew on that tree before George
ever had the hatchet,—yes, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Tell.</span> Santa, we are all in the

<p><span class="smcap">Dame Rumor.</span> Yes, William, I have heard
that apple shooting contradicted, too, and wasn’t that charming song,
“In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree,” written in honor of a tree that
sprang from some of those seeds that you shot out of the apple on
little William’s head that day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pocahontas.</span> Santa, you must not let such

Arthur and all the Knights of the Round Table are now considered merely
as a romance, if you please. So you see we are all in good company, my
friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick Whittington.</span> Yes, I also belong to

<p class="space-above1">In order to make this play practicable for
general use, the scenery and stage-directions suggested have been made
as simple as possible. Regarding costumes, it may be said the play can
be effectively produced when the children wear ordinary clothes, the
Puritan costume being suggested by white caps and deep collars and
cuffs for the women characters, and broad-brimmed hats and wide collars
for the men. These accessories can be easily made of very inexpensive
material, and copied from any of the well-known Puritan pictures. The
Indians may either appear in the Indian costumes possessed by so many
boys, or, in case these are unavailable, they may be draped in gay
blankets and wear feather head-bands, which may be easily imitated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE EGYPTIAN CAT</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120">(<i>A Shadow Play</i>)</p>

<p class="f150"><span class="smcap">By Irene Woodbridge Clark</span></p>

<p>The following little play was written for a special occasion, and was
successfully presented as a side show at a church fair. Tickets were
sold at ten cents each, and the performance, which was repeated several
times, netted forty-two dollars. The expense of getting up the play is
very slight. The screen upon which the shadows are thrown may be formed
of two or more large sheets, sewed firmly together, and stretched
smoothly from ceiling to floor, or to the platform of an improvised
stage. Several strong tables—kitchen tables, for instance—ranged in
line behind the screen, and as near to it as possible, would make an
excellent platform, for as the actors walk close to the curtain, a
wider flooring is not necessary. At each side of the stage and screen
a heavy shawl or blanket should be hung, so that the actors may be
concealed from the audience when not engaged in the performance. There
should be but one light to throw the shadows. A kerosene lamp is very
effective, if placed with the narrow side of the flame toward the
screen, the object being to concentrate the light, and cause it to
come from as small and yet as brilliant a point as possible. Set the
lamp in a box of some kind; a wooden soap box would do, with one side
open toward the screen. The box should be painted a dull black inside,
or old black cloth may be tacked in as a lining. If the inside of the
box is not black, it will reflect the light, and cause the shadows to
appear blurred. On no account use a reflector, as this would have the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
same effect. An opening may be cut through the box, just above the lamp
chimney, to allow the heat and smoke to escape. When it is necessary to
shut off the light, as at the end of each scene, or at the close of the
performance, this may be done by quickly sliding the cover of the box
across the open front, and thus obscuring the lamp entirely. The box
with the lamp should be about on a level with the actors’ feet, or a
trifle higher, and should be at least five or six yards behind them, if
possible to arrange it so.</p>

<p>All these arrangements are behind the screen. The audience is to be
seated on the other side. It is not necessary to conceal the screen
with a curtain, for if the light within the box is entirely cut off by
placing the cover in front, and if the portion of the room in which the
audience is seated is well lighted, no shadows from behind the screen
will appear before the proper time. When the hour for the performance
arrives, a decided stroke of a bell should be the signal for every
light in the audience room to be turned out, and at the same moment,
for the cover to be withdrawn from before the box containing the lamp.
If this is well managed, Scene 1, having already been arranged against
the screen, will instantly appear to the audience in sharp, black
shadows. At a second quick stroke of the bell, the reader begins the
play. Any one with a good clear voice may act as reader. The best place
for him to sit is behind the screen near the lamp. As he reads only
during the actual performance, he needs no other light, but he should
be careful that he does not place himself in such a position that his
own shadow is thrown on the screen. The cat and pedestal stand five
feet, eight inches in height. A few other measurements are given in
connection with Figure No. 1, and with these as a guide, the outline of
the cat and pedestal may be drawn of the proper size on a large sheet
of brown paper and then cut out and taken to a carpenter who will saw
the figure out of heavy board. The cat, who has already appeared before
the public, was cut out pedestal and all in one piece from a large
smooth, pine board, an inch in thickness, the cost being seventy-five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
cents. The pedestal was braced at the bottom so that the figure would
stand upright alone, but care was taken that no projection was made
on the side to be placed against the screen. A narrow strip of rough
fur was tacked all around the outer edge of the cat, except around the
feet, and this, with a fox tail, through which a strong piece of wire
was run, gave her a very real appearance when seen in shadow. The boy
or man, who managed her, sat on a stool behind the pedestal, and in
addition to working the eyes, tail, mouth, etc., would meow mournfully,
or spit fiercely, as the events of the play demanded. For further
directions as to the making of the figure and the working of the parts,
see explanation of diagrams. The lobster, spider, fishes, the maiden’s
heart, and the immense dollar used by her in Scene 2, her slippers,
curling tongs, and brushes, and even the tears she shed, were all cut
from pasteboard. Comical hats for the actors were made by taking old
shade hats and fastening ridiculous pasteboard shapes upon them. The
mice and rats which run by the cat in Scene 1, were cut from pasteboard
and were somewhat larger than life size. Four of them were tacked by
the feet to a long narrow strip of wood at about a foot apart, and to
one end of this board was fastened a small strong cord. When arranging
for Scene 1, this strip of board was laid in place at one end of the
stage, on the floor close to the screen, but the figures of the mice
were turned over on their sides, so that their shadows would not
appear. The cord which reached from the end of the board to the other
end of the stage lay along the floor close to the screen. During the
reading of verse third an assistant quickly turned up the board, so
that the mice instantly appeared in shadow, and a second assistant drew
it steadily by means of the cord across the stage between the cat and
the screen, until it was out of sight. The fly which buzzes around the
cat’s head in Scene 6 was also cut from pasteboard, and fastened to
the end of a rather fine wire, which was manipulated by the person in
charge of the cat. When not in use it was hung by a loop in the end of
the wire, on a nail fastened in the figure of the cat. In Scene 4, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
castle might be represented by a clothes-horse, covered by a heavy
shawl, or by a large screen placed flatly against the curtain. A
window is not an absolute necessity, as the heads of the maiden and
her suitors might appear over the top of the castle wall. To raise
these actors to the proper height a table or a number of strong wooden
boxes may be used to stand on. The ladder was a stepladder of a medium
size. It was kept hidden behind the castle wall until the lover pulled
it out. When he had arranged it in place, the maiden stepped from her
elevated position to the ladder, and thus descended. The cat which
appears in Scene 4, is a second one, cut from very stiff pasteboard and
braced in places with strips of wood. Two screw eyes are fastened into
the wood, at A and B, as seen in the diagram of the leaping cat. Just
before Scene 4, a strong slender cord is fastened to a nail driven in
the floor at the end of the stage farthest from the castle. This cord
is then passed through the two screw eyes in the cat, and the cat is
given into the care of one of the actors—one of the rivals, who stands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
behind the castle wall. He holds the cat in his left hand and the end
of the cord in his right, but allows the length of the cord to hang
loosely to the floor until the time for action. At the beginning of
the verse, “She fought until they both had fled,” he suddenly holds up
his arm, twists the cord about his hand and draws it tightly, and at
the words, “Leaping from the window sill,” with a quick motion lets
the cat go, when it rushes swiftly down the cord close to the screen,
and is caught by an attendant at the farther end, who himself remains
concealed. This cat is not nearly so large as the other, not being
over a yard in length. The lobster is about two feet in length. To the
upper part is fastened a strong linen thread, which passes through a
screw-eye in the ceiling above the stage or through a brass ring sewed
to the top of the screen. The other end of the thread is held by some
one at the side of the scene. The lobster may hang below the stage
platform, between it and the curtain, or may lie on the stage floor
until needed. When its turn comes to appear, the attendant draws the
thread and pulls it up into sight where it hangs flatly against the
screen. The spider is hung in the same manner and is held in place at
the top of the screen until time to drop upon the maiden’s head. A
pasteboard spider is better than a heavier one, as it responds more
quickly to the little pulls and jerks given to it and thus appears to
have more life. The maiden’s pasteboard heart is about six inches long.
By keeping the hand which holds it within the shadow of her figure she
may throw it from her open mouth apparently, without the action of her
hand and arm being seen. The effect may scarcely be called natural—who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
could expect it would be? But it never fails to produce a roar of
laughter. Picking up the heart again, the maiden opens her mouth and
appears to swallow it once more. After which she regains her composure,
which has been sadly disturbed. Sawdust poured from a pitcher appears
as a fine substitute for cream and can be used again and again. In
Scene 3 the cat seizes the rivals by the fingers. This effect is
produced by the rivals, one on either side of the cat, placing each a
forefinger in a corner of the cat’s mouth, and holding it there while
apparently trying to pull it away. If the rivals thus caught jump and
dance with pain, the effect is increased. The serving maid who brings
the tea in Scene 5 wears a cap and apron and carries a tray bearing a
number of unbreakable wooden and tin dishes which make a great clatter
in falling without causing any damage. The tea table, a small one,
supported by a single post in the center, may be cut from brown paper
and pinned on the screen before Scene 5 appears. In shadow it will
seem to be just as real as an actual table, but of course a real table
may be used if preferred. Several dozen curl papers, like lamp lighter
quills, may be sewed to a circular piece of muslin which is tied on top
of the rival’s head for Scene 5, and covered by his tall head dress.
When this head dress is suddenly removed, the quills stand out in all
directions.</p>

<p>A word to the actors. Let them keep so near to the screen in all
their acting that they actually touch it, and let their profiles be
constantly toward the spectators. The words of the play should be
familiar to each performer, that he or she may know what is coming
next, and be prepared to act on time. Many comical things will suggest
themselves to those taking part, if the play is entered into with spirit.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>EXPLANATION OF DIAGRAMS</b></p>

<p>The figure of the Cat having been sawed out of wood, it is ready to be
equipped with the other parts. Nearly one yard of cotton elastic, a
half or three quarters of an inch wide, will be needed. Also several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
screw eyes of medium size; a staple to fasten the tail; a firm piece of
wire which will not easily bend, about 18 inches long; a fox tail; 2¾
yards of any kind of rough fur, old or new; a spool of linen thread No.
25; a yard or two of strong, fine twine; a few strips of thin board,
of a kind that will not be easily split, and several pieces of thick,
strong pasteboard.</p>

</div>

<p>To make the eyeballs. Fold a piece of brown paper, and cut out in
what you judge the proper size, a copy of the small diagram marked X,
which is shown in <a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>, taking care that the fold of the
paper is at F. When the pattern is opened it will be found to be like the small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
diagram, EB. Pin this pattern in place on the wooden cat in the manner
shown in <a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>. If not of the proper size make another.
When you have a pattern that seems to be correct, lay it on the pasteboard and
outline it with a pencil. The resulting figure may then be cut out with
a sharp pocket knife. In the small holes made at each upper corner of
the cross-piece, H and H, fasten a piece of linen thread, about one
half a yard long. When the eyeballs are in place, these threads are to
be passed through the screw eyes fastened at the side of the cat’s head
at S and S, and brought around to the reverse side of cat’s head, where
they are tied together at the ends, thus forming a loose loop. Fasten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
the cross-piece in the center to a central point above cat’s eyes, by
means of a screw-eye or ordinary screw, as indicated in diagram. This
forms the pivot on which the eyeballs move, and as it is necessary that
they move very easily, the cross-piece should not be fastened down too
firmly. When the linen thread is pulled at the right or the left by the
operator who sits on the reverse side, the eyeballs will move from side
to side. The piece forming the jaw is cut from pasteboard in a similar
way. Across the lower part tack a strip of wood. To the center of this
strip fasten the end of the cord, C, which is used to pull the jaw
down. Cut two pieces of elastic each 6 inches long, and fasten to jaw
at K and K, having first tacked another strip of wood across. Lay the
jaw in place over the cat’s mouth, in such a position that the teeth of
the lower jaw will meet the teeth of the upper jaw. While holding the
jaw in this position, tack the free ends of the elastic to the cat’s
head as shown in diagram. This must be done <i>without stretching</i>
the elastic. When the cat stands erect the jaw will now hang in place.
Pass the cord, C, through the aperture A, which has been previously cut
in the body of the cat. When it is desired to open the cat’s mouth,
pull the cord down; the elastics will cause it to spring up in place
again when the cord is not held. The aperture A should be cut through
the wood with a downward slant; if cut straight, the light would show
through the opening. Figure 3 shows diagram of eyelids. These are to be
fastened on the other side of the cat, the side on which the operator
sits. The figure, EL is cut from pasteboard and stiffened by a long
narrow strip of wood, running crosswise through the central portion. A
loop of cord is fastened at R and R. Two strips of elastic, each seven
inches long, are fastened at Z and Z. The eyelid piece is then laid
in place over the eyes, in such a position that the eye sockets are
entirely covered. Then the other ends of the elastics are tacked to the
cat’s head at V and V, or wherever the ends happen to lie when laid out
smoothly, without stretching. Fasten a screw-eye or hook at H in cat’s
body, and pulling down the loop of cord, hook it under the screw-eye as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
shown in diagram, which will again leave the eye sockets exposed. When
it is desired to have the cat wink, unhook the loop, and pull the
eyelid piece up and down rapidly. When not using this contrivance,
always keep the loop hooked under the screw-eye, else the cat’s eyes
will appear to be closed. In regard to the tail—insert a stiff piece
of wire about 18 inches long, leaving the end of wire exposed for about
8 inches. Where the wire enters the tail at F, fasten it to the cat by
means of a staple but in such a way that it will move freely. To the
free end of wire fasten a piece of elastic nine inches long. Tack the
other end of this elastic to the cat’s body at E, as shown in <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Also fasten a piece of cord to the same end of wire, which may be used
to pull down the tail. It will spring up voluntarily as the elastic
draws it. The strip of fur is to be tacked all around the edge of cat’s
body, except around the feet, which would not show well in shadow if
surrounded by fur. When this is finished the cat is complete.</p>

<p>The operator should be quick but not nervous. To make the cat appear
life-like, he should keep all the mechanism at work as much as
possible, taking care to have her movements as much as possible in
harmony with the play. If he practises a little before the performance,
he can make the cat the center of interest. When the actors feed the
cat the operator should slowly pull down the jaw, and when the food is
received shut it again quickly. When the cat is supposed to speak the
operator should make the action of the jaw keep time with the words as
they are read. When any one approaches the cat, by moving the eyeballs
the operator may make it appear that the cat is looking in that
direction. A judicious amount of purring, growling, and hissing may add
to the interest, but it should not be too frequent.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak non-vis">THE SLEEPING BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class="f150"><span class="smcap">By Caroline Verhoeff</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>For children between the ages of seven and eleven.
All the parts may be taken by girls</i>)</p>

<p class="f120 space-above1"><b>DIRECTIONS FOR STAGING</b></p>

<p>But one full set of scenery is required, a wood scene. If the play
is presented in a large hall, the scenery may often be procured from
a local theater, at little, or no, cost. If a drawing-room is used,
a small wood scene, either mounted or unmounted, may be purchased
from Samuel French, 28 West Thirty-eight Street, New York City. Where
economy is desirable, the following home-made scenery will prove quite
satisfactory: <i>Background</i>, stretch a rope from one eight-foot
ladder to another. Hang sheets over the rope, and to the sheets fasten
wall-paper representing a forest. If a good grade of wall-paper is
selected, the effect is excellent. For the <i>wings</i> use two
large-sized clothes-horses covered as the background, and placed to
allow entrances to front and back. The backs of the clothes-horses are
hung with white sheets, and in the garret scene they are simply turned
to inclose the foreground of the stage, representing white walls. In
the last act, a pretty transformation may be effected by means of a
tarlatan curtain, green and hung with paper spring flowers, which is
allowed to roll down and cover the background by the Spring Fairy. Or,
if more convenient, strips of wall-paper with a design of flowers,
birds, or butterflies may be used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p class="f120 space-above1"><b>PROPERTIES</b></p>

<p>Two chairs, preferably gilt, for the King and Queen. A couch for the
sleeping Princess, and a robe to throw over her. This robe is made of
brown cambric, covered on one side with cotton batting and sprinkled
with “Christmas snow”; on the other with paper flowers and artificial
moss. One or more bare trees or branches. These last are not absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above1"><b>COSTUMES</b></p>

<p>These are made of cambric or sateen, in the brightest colors. For
King, Queen, and Page copy the pictures in any good fairy-tale book.
The Princess requires two costumes, a brown dress to represent the
earth in the fall, and one of bright green, hung with spring flowers,
to wear when she awakens in the spring. The Prince requires a suit of
the brightest gold, with long, flowing sleeves and strings of tinsel
hanging from his neck like rays of sunshine. The Fairies dress to
represent their respective parts as spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Winter should be all in white, with silver tinsel.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above1"><b>CHARACTERS</b></p>

<p class="space-below1">There may be as many Lords and Ladies as the stage can accommodate.
There <i>must</i> be three of each if the procession in Act II is to be
effective, but if the stage is very small, the two children who take
the parts of Prince and Princess in the last act may appear as a Lord
and Lady in the second. Two Lords and two Ladies will be sufficient for
the dance in the last act.</p>

garden chair at right toward front of scene. A heavy green curtain
should hang behind this and across the stage; this curtain, parting at
the time indicated, discloses the castle.</p>

<p>The castle can be made of paper or cloth on light frames. It should
be castellated, with open doorway and steps in front. But as no one
enters, the castle need not be strongly built. The stage setting can be
left to the taste and facilities of the managers.</p>

<p>Appropriate music should be played as accompaniment and during waits.
The airs for the choruses can be selected by any one familiar with

some solos can be arranged, and thus give variety to the performance.</p>

suit, walked rapidly up the palace corridors, past the guards and
soldiers, past the vassals and retainers, past the courtiers, the lords
and the ladies, past the King and the Queen—all fast asleep—to where
on a golden couch the beautiful Princess lay, wrapped in a death-like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
slumber. Marveling much at her wondrous beauty, the Prince bent
over the closed lids, and, all trembling with eagerness, kissed the
half-opened lips.</p>

<p>“With brazen clangor the palace clock struck the hour of noon. There
was a start, a murmur, a sudden awakening. King, Queen, and court threw
off their century sleep, and passed to their several duties. But the
Princess, meeting the beaming eyes of the brave and handsome Prince,
recognized at once the hero of her dream, and greeted him with an
entrancing smile. Then, rising quickly from her couch, a charming blush
suffusing her beautiful face, she took his hand, and leading him to the
King, her father, said:</p>

<p>“‘Behold, my Lord, the husband whom the fairies have sent me!’</p>

<p>“And the King, looking upon the young Prince, loved him so exceedingly
that he gave them both his blessing.</p>

<p>“So the gallant Prince and the beautiful Princess were married with
great pomp and ceremony, and lived happily together ever after.”</p>

</div>

<p class="f120 space-above1"><b>COSTUMES</b></p>

<p>The costumes for this play are simple, but very effective. The fairies
should all wear white—ordinary summer dresses do very well. Over these
are worn slips made of green cheese cloth. Each slip is made of one
piece, doubled and stitched together at the sides and to form the wide
kimono sleeves. The neck is cut out low for the girls and left high
for the boys, the bottom is slashed up to form points or scallops that
show the white dress underneath. The back is slit to allow room for the
fastening of the wings.</p>

<p>The wings are made by bending a piece of wire—one continuous piece
for each pair of wings—and covering this with pink tarlatan, doubled.
They were fastened between the shoulders by tapes that passed around
the chest and over the shoulders. Note the point of attachment for the
tapes, on the beginning of each wing and not on the wire connecting
them. When the tape is fastened only to the connecting wire the wings
droop too much. A little experimenting will ensure success. Sometimes,
if the adjustment is exactly right, the wings move a little with the
motion of the child’s shoulders, and look very real indeed. After the
wings are on, a bit of green cheese cloth is pinned across at their
base to conceal the attachment.</p>

<p>The little boy was dressed in a green tunic, belted in. The flower
wreaths may be made and left on the grass until they are needed, or the
fairies may bring them in with them. All the fairies wore flower hats,
made of crêpe paper of different colors, slashed in points so that they
looked like double tulips. Each cap was of two layers of paper, of
contrasting color—blue over white, white over pink, red over yellow, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>The mother’s costume need not be made especially for the play, but it
should be inconspicuous in color and simple in its lines. The witch has
the conventional peaked cap, hair hanging straight about her face, old
shawl, and big cane.</p>

<p>The part of the boy should be taken by a very little child—not more
than five years old, and preferably not over four.</p>

  <p class="center">Wire for Wings.<br /> Cap.<br /> Green Slip.</p>
</div>

<p>The fairy songs do not necessarily have to be sung, but they are
prettier if the children have true enough voices. They should not be
sung loud. If they are not sung they may be half intoned in a more
or less musical sing-song. The music as written is furnished with
very simple accompaniments, such as could be rendered out of doors by
guitars or mandolins, or two violins playing pizzicato. As given last
year a violin and harp were used, and the result was very beautiful.</p>

<p>“<i>I received one morning a message from poor Goldsmith that he was in
great distress, and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging
that I would come to him as soon as possible. I accordingly went as
soon as I was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested him for
his rent, at which he was in a violent passion. I perceived that he had
already changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira and a glass
before him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm,
and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated.
He then told me that he had a novel ready for the press, which he
produced to me. I looked into it, and saw its merit; told the landlady
I should soon return, and, having gone to a book-seller, sold it for
sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his
rent....</i>”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">Oliver Goldsmith’s lodgings, Wine Office Court,
Fleet Street, London. The walls are discolored, the furniture is old
and rickety. The floor, the chairs, and the tables are littered with
quantities of ragged books and loose papers.</p>

<p class="neg-indent space-above1">[<span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>,

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;<i>[After glancing impatiently
at the door several times, opens it and calls loudly.</i>]&emsp;Margery!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery.</span>&emsp;[<i>Coming in and curtseying.</i>]
&emsp;Did you want for anything, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp; Has that graceless brother
of yours not come back? Sure it’s above an hour since he set off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery.</span>&emsp;Oh, sir, Dick has never
been so long as that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;An hour, I tell you,
and the half of that besides! He’ll be playing at pitch-and-toss
in the court, I warrant you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery.</span>&emsp;Oh, sir, he’d not do
that—not when you sent him so particular!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;Never you be too sure, Margery,
of what folks will do or not do. There’s myself now. You’d never believe that
I could be so foolish as to sell a good song for a paltry five shillings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
But many’s the time I did it in the old town of Dublin, and climbed the
college wall at night to hear the verses sung in the streets too. Then,
like as not, some poor soul that needed the money more than I would
beg the crown piece from me before I found my way back to the wretched
garret where I lodged. But times have changed, Margery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery.</span>&emsp;[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>]&emsp;Yes, sir;
but, you see, sir, you still—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;[<i>Hurriedly.</i>]&emsp;Run
down to the door like a good maid, do, and see if Dick’s in
sight. [<span class="smcap">Margery</span> <i>goes out</i>; <span
class="smcap">Goldsmith</span> <i>paces up and down restlessly for a
moment, then, going to the table, opens the drawer noisily and rummages
among his papers.</i>] A plague on all landladies, say I! [<i>In a
tone of disgust.</i>] And not so much as an old song left to sell this
time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery.</span>&emsp;[<i>Reappearing,
timidly.</i>]&emsp;Dick’s not to be seen yet, sir. I ran to the end of
the court and looked as far as ever I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;[<i>Angrily.</i>]&emsp;A
pretty pass for a gentleman like me to be in!—unable to stir beyond the
four walls of the room, and very dirty walls they are, too [<i>with a
scornful look about him</i>], with that cowardly bailiff sitting on
the stairs, like a vile cat ready to pounce at any moment. And, unless
Dr. Johnson is as quick to send help as he is to contradict me at the
club, I must go to prison, and all because that mother of yours is so
vixenish about the trifle of rent. She knows I’d give away my last
halfpenny to any one who needed it.

<span class="smcap">Margery.</span>&emsp;[<i>Beginning to cry.</i>]&emsp;Yes, indeed,
sir; but that’s just it! Mother heard the young gentlemen who were here last
night talking in the passage about the guinea you’d given them to go
to the play; and then, this morning, she only asked for some of the
rent because she’s obliged to pay Dick’s fees to Mr. Filby, the tailor,
who’s willing to take him to ’prentice and teach him the trade if he
finds he’s a likely lad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;[<i>Excitedly.</i>]&emsp;But I haven’t another guinea to
my name, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="ws3">[<span class="smcap">Margery</span> <i>sobs loudly.</i>]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;[<i>Dreadfully distressed.</i>]
&emsp;You shall have a whole shilling for yourself, my girl, if you’ll give
over crying. But [<i>in a lower tone</i>], faith, I’ll have to get the
shilling first!</p>

<p>[<i>Door opens, and</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>enters,
much out of breath.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I’d a deal of trouble to give the letter to
the old gentleman in the Temple. Frank, the black man-servant, said at first
that his master, who could write a great book like the dictionary, all
out of his own head, had no call to be bothered with forward London
lads. Then he made me wait a long time while Dr. Johnson drank tea with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Miss Williams, the little old blind lady that lives there. But at last
the Doctor read your letter and gave me this one for you, with a penny
for myself. Then he called very loud for a man-servant, and said a lot
of things I couldn't rightly understand, the words were so long; but he
said “Scatter-brain!” at the end. Could that mean you, sir?</p>

<p><i>My Dear Sir</i>:</p>
<p>Your vexatious situation has awakened the liveliest

&emsp;Ah! 'tis a great thing to have real friends. And they're not always the
people that have the smoothest tongues, either. The Doctor's rough in his
speech, yet there's nothing of the bear about him but his skin.
&emsp;[<i>Remembering the children, with a start.</i>]&emsp;Here, Dick, old debts
must always be paid. I've promised Margery a shilling, and you shall
have sixpence. Run and change this guinea at the Green Dragon Tavern,

hard by.&emsp;[<span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>makes for the door.</i>]&emsp;But,
stay! If I must spend the day indoors, at least I'll have some good wine to keep
me company. You may as well bring a quart of Madeira, lad, the best
you can buy.&emsp;[<span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>goes out.</i>]&emsp;And,
Margery, there's an old corkscrew on the floor in yonder corner. There should be
a goblet, too, on the shelf. The other three were broken at our little meeting
last night, and the china monster I was always so fond of, too, because
Cousin Jane Contarine gave it to me. Ah, well!&emsp;[<i>Picking up some
fragments from the floor and placing them on a shelf.</i>]&emsp;I'll keep
the pieces to remind me of her.&emsp;[<span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>enters,
sets a dusty bottle on the table, and takes the change out of his various pockets,
piece by piece, with an air of great responsibility.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;[<i>Without counting the money.</i>]&emsp;Ah,
the boy at last! Here's a sixpence for you, lad.&emsp;[<span class="smcap">Dick</span>
<i>pulls his forelock and promptly pockets the coin.</i>]&emsp;And here's your shilling,
Margery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery.</span>&emsp;[<i>Taking it reluctantly.</i>]&emsp;I'll
be sure to tell Mother how kind you are, sir, and then perhaps—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;Perhaps she'll not let the bailiff carry
me off to prison? No use hoping for that, my dear, or for any other piece of
good luck, for that matter. Poor Noll will never gallop in a coach
and six, for all his hard work. But the sun shines sometimes even in
Fleet Prison, and here's good wine, for once, to make him forget his
troubles, so—

to investigate these complications.&emsp;[<i>Advancing to the center of

his ills with tea-drinking, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;[<i>Shaking his massive silver-headed

Miss Williams will testify, I hasten hither only to find that your
most pressing necessities are such as can be supplied from the nearest
tavern. The gold I despatched by your messenger, as from one literary

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;[<i>Ignoring</i> <span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Landlady.</span>&emsp;Begging your pardon, sir, I'm not a good 'and at

heverything to do for them, and gentlemen as 'as guineas to give away
promiscuous and owe rent for months don't pay a penny, though the lad's
to be 'prenticed and 'is fees found—as good a lad as there is in the

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;[<i>Very sternly, to</i> <span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>.]
&emsp;How, sir! Am I to understand that your indebtedness to this good woman
has covered a period of months?&emsp;[<span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span> <i>opens his mouth

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;That's like your old kindness, Doctor, and I'll be

publisher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;Not so fast, sir; not so fast! Keep your

worthier employment&emsp;[<i>glancing meaningly at the table</i>],&emsp;but
you shall set your roving wits to work for the discharge of your debt to
this poor woman here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;But I can't so much as take
a step without having that greasy fellow yonder hale me to prison, and no
man can write there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;Better men than you have written there,
sir, and to the glory of England, too! But your foolish errands can be done
for you. Have you scribbled nothing of late that you have not sold
before it was finished? No verses? The last—I should be wiser than
to tell you—were as sensible as their writer is foolish. Nothing?
[<span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span> <i>shakes his head.</i>] Nay, sit down and

completely forgot it. It's only a poor tale, though I liked it well
enough when I wrote it. But I've nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;What sort of tale, sir?
Is it a fable? Has it a moral?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;'Tis about a clergyman and his family.
I'd thought to call it “The Parson of Wakefield,” or some such name. I had my

my own mad doings as well. There's comfort sometimes in setting down
your own follies in print. It seems like a way of getting rid of them.
They're not all so easy to get rid of, though, more's the pity!</p>

maybe worse till the end of the chapter—[<i>He buries his face in his

What amount must be expended for the benefits of his presence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Landlady.</span>&emsp;It's twelve shillings for the warrant,
sir, and the stamp will be three more. 'E'll want two for 'is supper and ale, but
I'll not give it. 'E'd best get into an honest business and not come
cluttering up folk's 'ouses with 'is great hugly self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;Here are sixteen guineas, Madam,
and I desire you to pay the poor wretch's supper. 'Twas by no fault of his that
he came here.

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;[<i>Starting up.</i>]&emsp;Which of
the knaves did you talk into giving sixteen guineas for that poor tale?
I would never have believed it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;To be sure, sir, it would have been
another story had you carried your wares to market yourself, for the booksellers
have but an ill opinion of you at present. But there was no fear that
any one of them would venture to say <i>me</i> nay, or waste words
in cheapening what I chose to recommend. [<i>Impressively.</i>] Mr.
Newbery, your former publisher, has been pleased to purchase the work
which you intrusted to me, and to send you a remuneration of sixty guineas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span> Sixty guineas!&emsp;[<i>Sinks back on
his chair in astonishment.</i>]&emsp;Dick, lad, do you hear that? You shall have
the finest jack-knife in all Cheapside, my boy, and Margery a new bonnet
with flowered ribbons on it, for she was always sorry for me when
pence were hard to come by. And I&emsp;[<i>rising and strutting up and
down</i>]&emsp;shall be all the better myself for a little smartening.
I'll have another look at that marvelous pretty plum-colored velvet I
saw in Filby's shop last week. He'll be sure to trust me for it if I
pay something on the old bill, and—[<i>Stops short, as</i> <span class="smcap">Dr.
Johnson</span> <i>raps violently on the floor with his stick.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;[<i>Shaking his head solemnly.</i>]
&emsp;Nay, sir, a spendthrift you were born, but an honest man I'll make you,
if this money&emsp;[<i>holding up a large leather purse</i>]&emsp;will discharge
your outstanding accounts. There shall be no plum-colored velvets, I promise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
you, until justice is done. But&emsp;[<i>observing the downcast looks of the
children</i>]&emsp;you, my little mistress, shall not be deprived of your
finery, nor the lad of his promised toy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span>&emsp;[<i>Plucking up courage.</i>]&emsp;Then,
Doctor, you'll not leave me without a penny, like <i>Simple Simon</i> in the old rime?
Sure, no tradesman will trust me with his wares, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span>&emsp;[<i>Firmly.</i>]&emsp;And quite right
too, sir. But to leave you four and forty pounds in your present state of mind would
be sheer madness. Steady your wits, sir, by making a fair copy of your
debts, to show me at five, when Miss Williams shall give you a slice
of mutton in the Temple. On your solemn assurance that your creditors
shall be satisfied without delay, the balance shall be yours, though
it will be wasted on folly, I make no doubt. I have the honor to wish
you good day, sir.&emsp;[<i>Claps his hat on, seizes his stick, and marches

well! It's an ill wind that blows nobody good. Things looked black enough an hour
since, and now, Margery, you'll be monstrous fine in a new bonnet, and
Dick the cock of the court with his jack-knife. And I—I'll manage to
get that plum-colored velvet—with a taffeta lining, too—or my name's
not Oliver Goldsmith!</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
